\chapter{Methods}\label{CH:methods}

In this chapter, we describe a couple techniques that are used and referred to throughout the rest of the paper.
The first technique is the Schrieffer-Wollf transformation, also known as Lowdin partitioning or quasi-degenerate perturbation theory~\cite{winkler_2003}, in which we reduce a larger Hilbert space to a smaller more interesting space.
This is typically used to eliminate any undesired degrees of freedom.
The second technique is used to solve for the time dependency of the density matrix of a system.
This is done by solving the von Neumann equation and using a cumulant expansion to take the ensemble average of the system.
