	abstract = {We show that a set of gates that consists of all one-bit quantum gates [U(2)] and the two-bit exclusive-OR gate [that maps Boolean values (x,y) to (x,x⊕y)] is universal in the sense that all unitary operations on arbitrarily many bits n [U(2n)] can be expressed as compositions of these gates. We investigate the number of the above gates required to implement other gates, such as generalized Deutsch-Toffoli gates, that apply a specific U(2) transformation to one input bit if and only if the logical and of all remaining input bits is satisfied. These gates play a central role in many proposed constructions of quantum computational networks. We derive upper and lower bounds on the exact number of elementary gates required to build up a variety of two- and three-bit quantum gates, the asymptotic number required for n-bit Deutsch-Toffoli gates, and make some observations about the number required for arbitrary n-bit unitary operations., This article appears in the following collection:},

A solid-state quantum computer based on localized electron spins as qubits is therefore of potential interest. Here, a scheme that realizes controlled interactions between two distant quantum dot spins is proposed. The effective long-range interaction is mediated by the vacuum field of a high finesse microcavity. By using conduction-band-hole Raman transitions induced by classical laser fields and the cavity-mode, parallel controlled-not operations, and arbitrary single qubit rotations can be realized.},

Logical operations on individual spins are performed using externally applied electric fields, and spin measurements are made using currents of spin-polarized electrons. The realization of such a computer is dependent on future refinements of conventional silicon electronics.},

	abstract = {Microfabricated superconducting circuit elements can harness the power of quantum behaviour for information processing. Unlike classical information bits, quantum information bits (qubits) can form superpositions or mixture states of ON and OFF, offering a faster, natural form of parallel processing. Previously, direct qubit–qubit coupling has been achieved for up to four qubits, but now two independent groups demonstrate the next crucial step: communication and exchange of quantum information between two superconducting qubits via a quantum bus, in the form of a resonant cavity formed by a superconducting transmission line a few millimetres long. Using this microwave cavity it is possible to store, transfer and exchange quantum information between two quantum bits. It can also perform multiplexed qubit readout. This basic architecture lends itself to expansion, offering the possibility for the coherent interaction of many superconducting qubits. The cover illustrates a zig-zag-shaped resonant cavity or quantum bus linking two superconducting phase qubits.},

Unfortunately, charge noise can cause rapid decoherence, with typical single-qubit gate fidelities falling below \$90{\textbackslash}\%\$. Here, we develop analytical methods to study the evolution of strongly driven charge qubits, for general and \$1{\textbackslash}!/{\textbackslash}!f\$ charge-noise spectra. We show that special pulsing techniques can simultaneously suppress errors due to strong driving and charge noise, yielding single-qubit gates with fidelities above \$99.9{\textbackslash}\%\$.
